        Hello!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style = "text-align: left;">
        Welcome to my fancy shmancy art page! It gorgeous right? I'm grace that tornado of a human you met 
        (though honestly, idek if youd classify me as human, it's more accurate to say that tornado of an idea)
        Anyway... I gave you this link after I probably invited you to go fly too close to the sun with me or push a 
        boulder up a hill for eternity. Also to answer your burning question, yes I am better than you, thank you
        for asking. 
    </p>

        Okay enough rambling, I'll leave you alone so you can experience the wonders that happen when a world places
        me as the divine creator.
